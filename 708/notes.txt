If I try to do it brute force dont think i would never end, as wolfram
aborts online evaluation with 10^7 and takes more than 1 min wiht 10^5,
i dont think this is the way.

Idea 1:
	Can calculate how many numbers n there are with \Omega(n) = k,
	since 2^46 < 10^14 < 3*2^45 < 2^47 we just need to check to
	k = 45, cause there's only one number smaller than 10^14 with
	46 prime factors.
	It's obious that the numbers with \Omega(n) = k are the prime 
	numbers. For k = 2 we must find the conbinations between 2 primes
	that doesnt exceed 10^14, knowing the 2 primes can be the same,
	some at most there are (50 2) but we must find a bound condition.
