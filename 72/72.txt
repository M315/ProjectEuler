Tryed brute force and ends up being impossible.

Then in the wikipedia I fount a tree that generates all the pairs contained int
the set we are looking for. But end up with an algorithm growing exponentialy
that woud take too much too to the task.

Finally using the previous program i listed the first 20 elements and see that
in OEIS there were a match, witch show me the trick, that is using the Euler's
totient function to compute the elements given the number desiered

The solution is not implemented in C, tho its not that hard, but as its a one
liner in mathematica jeje:
	Sum[EulerPhi[m], {m, 1, 1000000}]-1
