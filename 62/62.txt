I make the gess that numbers to be cubed are smaller than 10000:
	
	This means that the cube have less than 12 digits and at least
	5 of them are diferent.
	So for every number from 400 (or more) to 10000 we can classify
	their cubes by writing them as x_0,x_1,x_2,...,x_9, where x_i
	is the number of digits i that have the cube, and since it's
	always smaller than 10 we can write it as a number base 10.

	[] make an array with the representations followed with the
	numbers that generate themand when one have 5 elements stop.

	Note: cubes must have the same number of digits i.e. 0XXX dont
	count.
	
	216~464		->	7 digits	[NO]
	465~999		->	8 digits	[NO]
	1000~2155	->	9 digits	[NO]
	2156~4641	->	10 digits	[NO]
	4642~10000	->	11 digits	[YES]
