Tryed burte force:
	take a, b ad compute c such that c*c = a*a + b*b and a + b + c <= L the
	algorithm is N^2 but takes too long when L >= 100000.

Solution:

The euler way to generate pytagorean triplets is a much better aproach since
all the ternes (a,b,c) generated are vaild ans we just have to compute if its
perimeter is alrady counted or not.
Note that the generators m, n must be coprime and not both odd in order to
generate a primitive triplet. And that primitibe triplets must be multiplied by
k = 1, 2,... in order to generate all the pitagorean triplets.
